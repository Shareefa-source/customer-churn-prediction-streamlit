## Customer Churn Prediction System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn significantly impacts revenue in subscription-based businesses.
The challenge is to identify customers likely to churn early so organizations can take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop an interactive machine learning application that:

Analyzes customer data

Trains a churn prediction model

Predicts churn probability for new customers in real time

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

I built an end-to-end churn prediction system using Python and Streamlit that integrates:

Data exploration

Visualization

Machine learning modeling

User-driven predictions
all within a single web application.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Streamlit (interactive app)

Pandas & NumPy (data processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (ML pipeline & modeling)

Joblib (model persistence)

---

## 📂 Data Description

User-uploaded customer dataset (CSV or Excel)

Mix of numerical and categorical features

Binary churn target variable selected dynamically by the user

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Displayed dataset structure, size, and missing values

Generated statistical summaries for numeric and categorical features

Visualized:

Feature distributions

Correlation heatmap for numeric variables

---

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%)

Built a Scikit-learn Pipeline combining:

StandardScaler for numeric features

OneHotEncoder for categorical features

LogisticRegression classifier

Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

---

## 📈 Results

Achieved stable predictive performance on unseen test data

Model outputs both:

Churn prediction (Yes/No)

Churn probability (%)

Enabled consistent predictions through saved pipelines

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

Streamlit interface allows:

Dataset upload

Model training with one click

Real-time churn prediction via form inputs

Designed for non-technical users (business teams, analysts)

Live App: http://localhost:8503/

---

## 💡 Business Impact

Supports early churn detection

Enables data-driven customer retention strategies

Scalable to telecom, banking, SaaS, and SME contexts
